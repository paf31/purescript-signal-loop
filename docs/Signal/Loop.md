## Module Signal.Loop

This module defines a higher-level abstraction on top of channels,
called _signal loops_. A signal loop is a function which produces a
signal, given partial information about its own future values.

#### `Emitter`

``` purescript
type Emitter eff a = Channel a -> Eff eff Unit
```

An `Emitter` is a function which renders a state and emits new values
onto a `Channel`. For example:

- a function which renders a HTML document and emits generated DOM events.
- a function which prints some text and emits console input.

#### `Loop`

``` purescript
type Loop eff a = Signal a -> Signal (Emitter (chan :: Chan | eff) a)
```

A loop is a function from a future input signal to an `Emitter` of values
of the same input type.

#### `runLoop`

``` purescript
runLoop :: forall eff a. a -> Loop eff a -> Eff (chan :: Chan | eff) (Signal a)
```

Run a loop, given an initial value.
The effects of the `Emitter`s are run inside of Eff. The initial value and
the emitted values are provided by the Signal in this Eff's return value.
If you aren't using these values outside of your `Emitter`s then you donâ€™t
need to use this Signal.
