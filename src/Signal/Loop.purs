-- | This module defines a higher-level abstraction on top of channels,
-- | called _signal loops_. A signal loop is a function which produces a
-- | signal, given partial information about its own future values.

-- | An `Emitter` is a function which renders a state and emits new values
-- | onto a `Channel`. For example:
-- |
-- | - a function which renders a HTML document and emits generated DOM events.
-- | - a function which prints some text and emits console input.
type Emitter eff a = (a -> Eff eff Unit) -> Eff eff Unit

-- | A loop is a function from a future input signal to an `Emitter` of values
-- | of the same input type.
type Loop eff a = Signal a -> Signal (Emitter eff a)

-- | Run a loop, given an initial value.
-- | The effects of the `Emitter`s are run inside of Eff. The initial value and
-- | the emitted values are provided by the Signal in this Eff's return value.
-- | If you aren't using these values outside of your `Emitter`s then you donâ€™t
-- | need to use this Signal.
